        <p id = "paragraph_1">During my freshman year when I applied to be a sysadmin, 8 out of 73 applicants were selected. Since then, I have contributed to the team and currently hold the position of Documentation Co-Lead. My responsibility includes maintaining documentation of systems in the lab for future sysadmins to reference. However, I also contribute to the other teams.</p>
