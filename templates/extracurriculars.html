    <h2>NASA Internship</h2>
    <p>In a team of 12 interns and under the guidance of a NASA engineer, we designed, built, and programmed two CubeSats as a proof-of-concept for wireless power transmission using collimated light (essentially a laser). The transmitting CubeSat pointed directly at the receiving side of the other CubeSat, then shot a beam of light towards it. A concave lens then diverged the light to spread across a solar panel to convert the light into energy. The real-world application of this is to provide power for satellites conducting missions on the dark side of the Earth, when they need more power than their solar panels can provide to run computationally expensive and energy-intensive programs, etc. <br><br> During the six weeks, we were expected to plan all the details and bring them to fruition by ourselves; however, we were provided with technical mentors to whom we could ask questions. I worked mostly on the software aspect of this mission. This included using inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, such as accelerometer and gyroscope readings, as well as GPS data to properly position the satellites so they would face each other while in orbit. For the fine-tuning of positioning for firing the laser, we used computer vision to identify the center of the four LEDs on the corners of the receiving satellite from a visual camera feed. Then, we coded the motors to move the reaction wheels accordingly, and then a magnetorquer dumped the excess angular momentum to stabilize the CubeSats.</p>

    <h2>Webmaster & Analytics Intern</h2>
    <p>I am currently an Operations Assistant and Analytics Intern at Noesys Inc. I assisted in the initial development of the company’s website and helped write Python scripts to automate various tasks. I currently maintain and update the website, using my experience as a webmaster for both my Boy Scouts troop and the Psychology Society club at my school. <br><br> In Boy Scouts, being the webmaster is not so much a technical job as it is one of responsibility. It is a simple website maintained on Google Sites, yet the troop relies on it for crucial information, so it is up to me to update it regularly and accurately. In Psychology Society, although I have similar important responsibilities, it is also more of a technological challenge— it is a website created with Node.js and Express. When I first became the webmaster for the club, it was a major learning curve for me to learn such different coding languages than what I was used to. However, through the Web Development course I was taking at school, as well as personal studying and learning, I was able to rise to the challenge.</p>

    <h2>Congressional Debate</h2>
    <p>I am part of my school’s Congressional Debate team. As a member, I attend club meetings and various competitions and have learned to improve my public speaking, critical thinking, and research skills. <br><br> My most memorable debate experience was my first tournament. I studied the format of Congressional Debate, watched previous national champions give speeches, and prepared extensive research on all the topics up for debate. However, I soon realized how relatively unprepared I was. The issue wasn’t a lack of knowledge about the topics or confusion about the procedures— I was unprepared in terms of skill. Although I had written speeches, the other competitors were on a whole different level because they were making their speeches spontaneously. This helped them answer their opponents’ questions with ease, whereas I struggled under the pressure of not being able to think on my feet; so, I took it upon myself to learn. Through hours of practicing making impromptu speeches, focusing on my eloquence and delivery, I have successfully been able to develop and improve this skill. With this new ability, I was able to place first at the most recent local tournament, WACFL 4.</p>

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence Researcher</h2>
    <p>As part of a five-person team working under the guidance of an MIT PhD student, I coded a skin cancer detection model in Python and deployed it as a web application. Using libraries like Keras, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the program can identify details of skin lesions solely based on a picture to determine whether they are benign or malignant. After the completion of the project, my team and I presented our research in front of an audience of around 150 people. <br><br> To prepare for the task of coding such a project, I conducted my own research on such applications by reading various research papers. I also worked on several smaller machine learning projects relating to Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. For instance, I coded a basic sentiment analysis model that can be used in conjunction with a stock analyzer I created to predict market trends. This entire research and preparation experience introduced me to real-world applications of deep learning models. I also gained even more expertise in Python and many machine learning libraries, especially Keras, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.</p>

    <h2>Director of Web Development at BranchOut</h2>
    <p>Over the course of two weeks, I volunteered for 20+ hours to help create a website made for victims of Asian hate to connect and find sources of support and assistance. The leaders of the team saw my dedication, so I was offered a leadership position as a director of the team. During the summer of 2022, I led a team of about 35 students to code multiple websites and applications for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from mental health help to preparing students for SOL testing. Finally, during the course of the 2022-2023 school year, I organized weekly meetings where we discussed and planned out the work that needed to be completed before the next session. <br><br> Through creating such applications, I learned more about app and web development. However, more than technical skills, this experience taught me leadership. For the first time, I was in charge of such a large group of students. However, I was able to implement skills I learned from leadership positions held at Boy Scouts and school clubs to guide the team to create professional products.</p>

    <h2>Technology Student Association</h2>
    <p>I recently became a member of my high school’s Technology Student Association team. To become a member of the team, I had to design a device to solve an everyday issue and write a paper about it. I chose to create EcoGrind: a product that crushes organic waste in schools to make pulp that can be converted to fertilizer. It would be available for less than $15 per unit and does not require electricity to operate, making it easily accessible to schools around the nation. After creating an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AYHBuHJTNtTYFKdsjMLCeQwf_LScY18A/view">animated CAD model</a>, I was selected to be interviewed as a final candidate. After discussing my qualifications for various events in TSA, such as Coding, I was chosen to be part of the team. <br><br> I participated in the Leadership Conference competition, where I placed second for my event, Essays on Technology. For the state competition, I was part of three events. In Essays on Technology, I placed fourth; in Webmaster, my team and I also earned fourth; in Software Development, we qualified for Nationals at third place.</p>

    <h2>w3-Study Creator</h2>
    <p>I was first introduced to the world of computer science in middle school with a simple “Hello World” program in Java. From there, I moved on to learning website languages, such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, and found that I enjoyed it very much. There is just something captivating about creating something from the ground up; a blank white page turning into a fully functioning website. <br><br> My first major project with a website created from scratch was when I started coding w3-Study during the summer of 8th grade. The goal of w3-Study is to provide students with a tool to organize study sessions in order to work collaboratively. This allowed me to use the skills I had acquired over the previous months to make a website that would actually be purposeful. It taught me many technical skills, of course, but an unexpected advantage of this project was the mindset it formulated. There were many times that I faced various technical issues, especially considering this was my first time working with a database. However, I persevered and developed a problem-solving mindset. Now, w3-Study serves as a useful tool for me and others.</p>

    <h2>Tae Kwon Do</h2>
    <p>Tae Kwon Do has been an integral part of my life for more than 7 years. As a black belt, I was a leader of my Tae Kwon Do school’s demo team, which required practicing for hours before every event to perfect our technique and synchronization. I also assisted classes with younger students, such as by correcting stances and demonstrating kicks. These experiences truly shaped who I am today by teaching me perseverance, determination, and other valuable traits. <br><br> The journey to becoming a black belt was extremely difficult, testing both my mental and physical limits. One of the most straining challenges was the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of normal classes, we had to turn to online Zoom meetings. This required much more motivation and self-guidance, especially because it was during an incredibly important time: just a few months before my black belt exam. However, backed by a mindset produced by years of doing Tae Kwon Do, I was able to persevere and thrive in my training. After two rounds of rigorous examination that tested my technique, ability, strength, and endurance, I was able to pass the test and earn my black belt.</p>

    <h2>National Honor Society</h2>
    <p>This past quarter, I was inducted into my school’s chapter of the National Honor Society. It is an honor to be part of this national organization, and I aim to contribute to the TJHSST Chapter’s mission by doing as much volunteer work as possible. <br><br> To qualify for NHS, applicants must demonstrate academic excellence and have at least eight hours of community service in the first semester of their application year. I volunteered at my local senior citizen center, which entailed setting up games for the seniors, helping them with technology, and cleaning up the cafeteria after lunch. As a member of the National Honor Society, it is now my duty to complete at least six hours of service per semester. I will do this by volunteering at the senior center, my school’s food drives, and other organizations, such as Feed Hungry People.</p>

    <h2>Siddharth Memorial Charitable Trust (SMCT) English Tutor</h2>
    <p>For two months during the COVID-19 pandemic, I tutored a student in India named Shivam. He had been learning English as a second language, but he wasn’t fluent because he didn’t have much practice. So, I helped him improve his spoken English. We called for two hours every morning and had general conversations. When he struggled to put something into words, he said it in Hindi (his native language), and I was able to translate it for him since I speak Hindi as well. He became much more fluent in English over the course of our time together, and it was an amazing experience to see him grow. <br><br> Through this volunteering, I developed a passion for language. I combined it with my interest in computer science to create a natural language processing tool that analyzes users’ grammar and pronunciation. Then, it offers suggestions for improvement, as well as tailored practice. I am currently working on improving its accuracy further and expanding it to different languages. I hope to make it available to the public within the next year so people like Shivam can benefit.</p>

    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <p>In middle school, I ideated and modeled the AeroHydroBottle, a water bottle that can convert humidity in the air to water without any external energy source other than sunlight. It uses a zinc-based iteration of a hydrophilic polymer network known as hydrogel to retain, purify, and condense moisture from the air to make drinking water. I submitted this innovation in various competitions and received accolades for my work. <br><br> Last year, I developed a prototype of the T-REX (Tunable Resonance Electricity eXperiment), a tile that generates electricity from mechanical and sonic energy by utilizing piezoelectric materials. My team and I created a working model and were honored to be named as Conrad Innovators in the Conrad Challenge. We are currently taking this product to the next level by conducting research with Professor Liling Huang at George Mason University as to how we can increase its efficiency. Creating these products helped me improve my research skills and creativity; I aim to apply this knowledge to my position as an intern at NASA.</p>
